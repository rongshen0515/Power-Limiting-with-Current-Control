# Power-Limiting-with-Current-Control

Capstone for TR Embedded 

Basically I am improving and making sure the power limiting algorithm works on the TR robots. What is happening is we need to improve the algorithm so that the robot is smart enough to understand how much 
power is needed to be allocated to moving and beyblading. We do this by controlling the current flowing into each motors. This process can be called as "dynamic beyblading". 

Everything is still in progress and not close to completion at all.
